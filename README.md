# bdlang

Define a variable using the following structures (currently only numbers are supported. Soon string values will also be supported.)
```
define variableName = value;
```
Currently this language can handle variable definitions and simple mathematics using the variable values also.



To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
